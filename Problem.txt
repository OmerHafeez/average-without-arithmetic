You are working at an embedded systems software. Your primary goal is speed, and
you are researching on ways to optimize the overall speed and responsiveness of the system. You
notice that whenever you perform multiplication or division, your program takes a longer than
desired time to do it. You are researching on ways to increase this speed, as a core functionality of
your program is computing the average of numbers. Your goal is to find the average of two
numbers WITHOUT using arithmetic operators.
